# DevClinic - Welcome Email Implementation

## Project Overview

DevClinic is a healthcare platform connecting patients with doctors, allowing for appointment scheduling, medical record management, and secure communications.

## Welcome Email Implementation

A welcome email has been implemented to send personalized greetings to new users when they log in for the first time. This email is sent once per user and includes instructions about using the platform, signed by "Aakash - CEO & Founder".

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
- **Location**: `server/models/user.js`
- **Changes**: Added `welcomeEmailSent` boolean field to the User schema to track if a welcome email has been sent
```javascript
welcomeEmailSent: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
}
```

### Email Template
- **Location**: `server/utils/emailTemplates.js`
- **Function**: `welcomeEmailTemplate(userName)`
- **Design Features**:
  - Personalized greeting with the user's name
  - Beautifully styled sections with a gradient header
  - Feature grid showcasing key platform capabilities
  - Step-by-step getting started instructions
  - CEO signature ("Aakash - CEO & Founder")
  - Responsive design for various devices and email clients

### Email Sending Function
- **Location**: `server/utils/emailService.js`
- **Function**: `sendWelcomeEmail(email, name)`
- **Purpose**: Handles the actual email sending process with proper error handling and logging

### Integration Points
- **Regular Login**: Updated in `server/routes/userRoutes.js` 
  - Checks if user has received welcome email already via `welcomeEmailSent` flag
  - Sends welcome email if user is verified but hasn't received welcome email
  - Updates the user record to prevent duplicate emails

- **Google Sign-In**: Also updated in `server/routes/userRoutes.js`
  - Handles both new and existing Google users
  - Sends welcome email if it hasn't been sent before
  - Updates the user record to track email status

## Complete Login Flow

1. **User Registration**:
   - User registers via form (`/register` endpoint)
   - System saves user with `isEmailVerified: false`
   - System sends verification email with token

2. **Email Verification**:
   - User clicks link in verification email
   - System updates user with `isEmailVerified: true`
   - User can now log in

3. **First Login**:
   - User logs in with valid credentials
   - System checks `welcomeEmailSent` flag
   - If `false`, system sends welcome email and updates flag to `true`
   - User is authenticated and enters the dashboard

4. **Google Sign-In Flow**:
   - User signs in with Google account
   - For new users, system creates account with `isEmailVerified: true`
   - System checks `welcomeEmailSent` flag
   - If `false`, system sends welcome email and updates flag to `true`
   - User is authenticated and enters the dashboard

## Email Template Structure

The welcome email includes:
- DevClinic header with gradient background
- Personal greeting with user's name
- Welcome message box with green accent
- 4-panel feature grid highlighting platform capabilities
- Numbered list of getting started steps
- Dashboard link button
- CEO signature block
- Footer with copyright information

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

If welcome emails are not being sent:
1. Check email server configuration in `.env`
2. Verify that `welcomeEmailSent` is `false` in the user document
3. Look for errors in server logs related to email sending
4. Ensure the email template is properly exported in `emailTemplates.js`
